## Stop Fargate

I can't find menu for "Stop Fargate".
So, we should `remove api` or `delete`.

### remove api

```
$ amplify remove api
$ amplify push
```

> **Warning!**
> 
> This operation removes `amplify/backend/api/container` directory.

### delete

```
$ amplify delete
```

> **Warning!**
> 
> This operation deletes this project.
